    <p>The 2017 Thai National Championships was the second Thai Nationals I competed in. The first one I competed at was in 2016. I places second that year. I then trained really hard the next year with the hopes of winning Thai Nationals the next year. I was able to compete at Thai Nationals becuase my father is from Thailand so I have dual U.S. and Thai citizenship. 
        It was held in April 2017 and after adjusting to the time change for a few days, it was time for me to compete. The ice rink is in Samrong, which is an area of Bangkok, Thailand's capital city. I was much more comfortable competing in 2017 because I had already skated in the ice rink in the previous year. It is an Olympic size ice rink which is bigger than the hockey size ice rinks that I trained in back in Boston.

    <p>When it finally came to competition day, I competed my short program which is a 2:50 minute routine consisting of 3 jumps and 3 spins. I was so excited to land my triple flip jump and ended up being in first place after the short program. The next day I had to compete my long program which consists of 7 jumps and 3 spins. I again landed my triple flip jump, the hardest element in my program. I was super nervous to see how I would place overall but I ended up winning first place!</p>
    <br/>
    <p> This competition was super exciting and I am so grateful that my training paid off and I was able to become the Thailand National Champion. I competed at the highest level, but the competition also had lower level for younger skaters, so it was a long event lasting a total of 4 days. Because I won first place, I was able to represent Thailand at several international competitions. Some of my favorite international competitions are the ones mentioned on this website!</p>
